[00:19.77] Kamikaze 2, the album where you reply to everybody
[00:23.88] Who didn''t like the album that you made
[00:26.16] Replying to everybody that didn''t like the previous album
[00:29.89] It''s a slippery slope

[00:38.25] Don''t fall on my
[00:39.12] Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
[00:40.81] Got no time to waste, I''m already late, I got a marathoner''s pace
[00:43.92] Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
[00:47.89] Guess I got a chronic case
[00:49.17] And I ain''t just blowin'' smoke, ''less it''s in your mama''s face
[00:51.65] I know this time Paul and Dre, they won''t tell me what not to say

[00:56.91] You''d swear to God I''ve forgot I''m the guy that made "Not Afraid"
[00:59.55] One last time for Charlemagne
[01:00.80] If my response is late, it''s just how long it takes
[01:02.78] To hit my fuckin'' radar, I''m so far away
[01:04.86] These rappers are like Hunger Games
[01:06.28] One minute, they''re mocking Jay
[01:07.54] Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
[01:10.28] Maybe I just don''t know when to turn around and walk away

[01:14.76] I''ve had as much as I can tolerate
[01:16.16] I''m sick and tired of waitin'', I done lost my patience
[01:18.31] I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once

[01:36.34] Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
[01:38.78] Or have his body baggage zipped
[01:40.25] The closest thing he''s had to hits is smacking bitches
[01:42.73] And don''t make me have to give it back to Akademiks
[01:44.93] Say this shit is trash again, I''ll have you twisted like you had it
[01:47.68] When you thought you had me slippin'' at the telly
[01:49.25] Even when I''m gettin'' brain, you''ll never catch me with a thot
[01:52.25] Lacking with it, "He ain''t spittin'' like this in his last shit"
[01:54.47] Hoe, you better go back and listen

[02:02.66] Kathy Griffin stackin'' ammunition
[02:04.13] Slap the clip and cock it back on competition
[02:06.02] This is how I shot a head (Pew)
[02:07.93] Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
[02:10.81] Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a f-t, bitch
[02:13.77] It''s not just ''cause you lack attention
[02:15.02] It''s because you worship D12''s balls, you''re sac-rilegious
[02:18.03] If you''re gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
[02:21.23] Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you
[02:23.69] Put together some words, more than just two letters
[02:25.65] The fans waited for this moment
[02:27.09] Like the feature when I stole the show
[02:28.84] Sorry if I took forever
[02:30.09] Don''t fall on my face (Yuh)

[02:43.43] It''s too easy

[02:47.26] And I''ll be here after you make your run-in for you
[02:49.76] Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
[02:52.31] Just what the doctor ordered
[02:53.74] Revenge is the best medicine
[02:55.02] Increase the dose, from least to most
[02:56.57] Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
[02:58.21] They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
[03:00.65] So they nominate ''em, get ''em there, get a name to ''em
[03:03.08] See the show, every parasite needs a host
[03:05.13] Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one''s ever even heard of
[03:08.69] All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
[03:11.95] Time to separate the sheep from goats
[03:13.66] And I got no faith in your writers, I don''t believe in ghosts
[03:16.21] When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
[03:19.08] A beacon of hope, for the B-I-R-D in the air
[03:21.57] Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
[03:24.19] That''s who I''m doin'' it for, the rest I don''t really even care
[03:26.71] But you would think I''m carryin'' a Oxford dictionary
[03:28.81] In my pocket how I''m buryin'' these artists
[03:30.92] On the scale it turns to minus
[03:32.29] Mines is various as hardly and what''s scary is
[03:34.47] You prolly can compare me to your car ''cause I''m just barely gettin'' started
[03:37.82] And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
[03:39.93] Or I''ll show you an Elvis clone
[03:41.55] Walk up in this house you own
[03:42.60] Thrust my pelvic bone
[03:43.61] You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
[03:46.04] Put my feet up and just make myself at home
[03:48.10] I belong here, clown!
[03:49.64] Don''t tell me ''bout the culture
[03:50.92] I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5''9"s, and oh
[03:55.87] Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned
[03:58.52] But I''m not gonna fall, bitch! (Yuh)

[04:08.97] ''Cause I don''t get compared to it, only myself now
[04:10.66] And I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
[04:12.37] But the only way I care is if I let myself down

[00:32.95] Getting drenched by the cheese, spend ''em rain and shine
[00:35.35] They head to another one, can''t decline
[00:37.65] What up to the DJ, straight to the back
[00:40.08] Ten racks to the waitress, change for all that
[00:42.52] Twenty something years old, ass so fat
[00:44.92] Them boys in the club, D hats all black
[00:47.23] Tops coming off, ass on the floor
[00:49.48] Guess ten ain''t enough, so I gotta get more
[00:51.83] They''ll lose their mind if I head to the door
[00:54.30] They don''t love me, they love the bread I blow
[00:56.82] God damn, got em on they hands and they knees
[00:58.83] Scratching after scratch like rats for the cheese

[01:06.05] I''ve got a white girl
[01:26.99] She''s a dancer (It''s Tricky!)
[01:29.13] She do whatever I say, no matter what I ask her
[01:31.37] Her action''s the answer (Talk to)
[01:33.96] Of course she know I got a black girl
[01:35.85] Who''s also a dancer
[01:38.23] Don''t talk about your life, don''t wanna hear about your bottles and ice
[01:41.15] Cause we got Marshall out the house tonight
[01:42.84] Stay awake
[01:44.20] I''m in VIP with no ID with a pint of Beam
[01:45.06] Lightin'' cheeba, wylin'' the fuck out like Bieber at nineteen
[01:47.17] Or Ice-T in the 90s
[01:48.71] Frightening in some Nikes slut, nice D''s
[01:51.28] There a slight breeze? Don''t like me? Well then bite me
[01:52.35] There might be a better chance of flight 370 turning up than us, bitch (highly unlikely)
[01:55.21] Little dyke think ''cause I''m Libra - you''re Pisces, and you''re feisty
[01:58.33] That you''re like me, that you might find that we''re like minded
[02:00.61] We ain''t nothing alike Diva, you like sleeves
[02:02.57] I''m a wife beater you white tease
[02:03.69] Bet you like skiing though right skeez?
[02:05.09] The way you''re damaging yourself on the poles

[02:09.22] And look out like you''re sightseeing and invite me in the back and bite me in the (God damn)
[02:12.93] Shake that ass and titties Cassidy felt that
[02:14.38] Dick so fat it could practically snap her chastity belt strap
[02:16.45] Standing all in the back where my hotels at
[02:18.24] She actually fell back and landed on somebody else''s lap
[02:20.90] And laughed, thought she sat on Pharrell''s hat
[02:22.39] (Twerk dat, pop that)
[02:39.92] Fresh out of damn near everything I had
[02:42.48] Lil homie, just grabbed the whole damn bag
[02:44.55] I could spend all year, never blow my stacks
[02:46.82] Getting white boy wasted, hold my mac
[02:49.41] Back to the spot, roll some up
[02:51.52] So blown last night I toked some up
[02:54.29] Lookers want anything, ain''t got enough
[02:56.57] In the club without bra''s ready to get fucked
[02:58.95] They drinking, smoking, touching, rubbing
[03:01.24] Rolling, crowd''s in love with my thugging
[03:03.61] Lick it, taste it, kiss it, suck it
[03:06.05] SHIT! Tryna see who want fucking
[03:08.20] Drop that thong, grab that pole
[03:10.38] Bend it over, let me see what I can do with that (OH!)

[00:02.65] An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin''
[00:05.13] But don''t think I ever stopped
[00:06.53] To think that I was speakin'' to children
[00:08.05] Everything was happenin'' so fast
[00:09.11] It was like I blinked—sold three million
[00:10.71] Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin'' ridiculous
[00:12.71] ''Cause I was gettin'' sick of this feelin''
[00:14.42] Like I''m always under attack, man
[00:15.84] I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin''

[00:28.74] If it contradicts how I''m livin'', put a dick in your rear end
[00:30.95] That''s why every time you mentioned a lyric
[00:32.87] I thanked you for it, for drawin'' more attention toward it
[00:35.30] ''Cause it gave me an enormous platform
[00:37.08] I''m flattered you thought I was that important
[00:39.00] But you can''t ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
[00:41.30] And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
[00:43.76] Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I''d just zone out
[00:45.85] Good luck tryin'' to convince a blonde

[01:33.43] Nah, I''m off him

[01:35.90] The fight was fixed, I''m back and you can''t stop me

[01:39.46] I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
[01:41.59] You''re gonna have to beat the fuckin'' pants off me
[01:43.80] To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
[01:45.25] Momma said there ain''t nothin'' else to talk about
[01:47.34] Better go in that ring and knock ''em out

[01:50.34] It''s poetry in motion
[01:52.04] Like Freddie Roach when he''s quotin'' Shakespeare
[01:54.69] So what if insults are revoltin''?
[01:57.04] Even Helen Keller knows life stinks

[02:00.28] But you should give little shit what I think
[02:01.92] This whole world is a mess
[02:04.13] Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest

[02:18.33] My soul''s escapin'' through this asshole that is gapin''
[02:21.49] A black hole and I''m swallowin'' this track whole
[02:23.19] Better pack toilet paper, but I''m takin'' no crap, ho
[02:25.51] Here I go down the Bat Pole
[02:27.40] And I''m changin'' back into that old maniac

[02:56.71] I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
[02:59.55] For thinkin'' we had some magnetic pull
[03:01.65] Then screamed, "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin'' magnets work?"
[03:03.69] ''Cause you''re attractive, but we ain''t attractable
[03:06.26] Hate to be dramatical, but I''m not romantical
[03:08.79] I''m makin'' up words so you can understandable, it''s tragical
[03:10.43] Thinkin'' some magical shit''s gonna happen, that ain''t practical
[03:14.18] You crackin'' a joke, it''s laughable
[03:15.83] ''Cause me and love''s like a bad combination

[03:30.17] You''re a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
[03:32.17] Shorty, you''re fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
[03:35.76] ''Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
[03:38.47] Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
[03:40.02] ''Cause you''re on my ass but you can''t get a cent
[03:42.40] ''Cause all of my spare time is spent
[03:43.94] On my nose in this binder, so don''t bother tryin''
[03:45.95] Only women that I love are my daughters
[03:47.64] But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I''m a father
[03:50.59] And I push it farther
[03:51.64] So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
[03:54.62] It''s apparent I shouldn''t have been a parent
[03:56.34] I''ll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
[03:58.01] And motherfuck father time
[03:59.88] It ain''t never gonna stop, a pessimist
[04:01.97] Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
[04:04.02] So even if I''m half-dead, I''m half-alive
[04:05.64] Poured my half-empty glass in a cup

[04:17.23] And dry up your teardrops, I''m here
[04:20.18] White America''s mirror, so don''t feel awkward or weird
[04:20.86] If you stare at me and see yourself because you''re one too
[04:24.13] Shouldn''t be a shock, because everybody knows

[03:17.39] But it''s honestly futile if I don''t utilize what I do though
[03:20.78] For good at least once in a while
[03:21.42] So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
[03:24.32] To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
[03:26.78] But I gotta keep a few punchlines
[03:29.18] Just in case ''cause even you unsigned
[03:30.70] Rappers are hungry lookin'' at me like it''s lunchtime
[03:32.30] I know there was a time where once I
[03:34.86] Was king of the underground
[03:35.93] But I still rap like I''m on my Pharoahe Monch grind
[03:37.86] So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
[03:39.92] Appeal with the skin color of mine
[03:41.45] You get too big and here they come tryin''
[03:43.75] To censor you like that one line
[03:45.28] I said on "I''m Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
[03:47.87] Tried to say I''ll take seven kids from Columbine
[03:49.86] Put ''em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
[03:52.87] See if I get away with it now that I ain''t as big as I was, but I''m
[03:56.86] Morphin'' into an immortal, comin'' through the portal
[03:59.32] You''re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
[04:01.81] And I don''t know what the fuck that you rhyme for
[04:03.45] You''re pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin'' cornrows
[04:05.84] You write normal? Fuck being normal!
[04:08.48] And I just bought a new raygun from the future
[04:09.95] Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
[04:12.39] ''Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather''s pad
[04:14.42] Singin'' to a man while he played piano
[04:16.19] Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
[04:19.53] So Ray J went straight to the radio station
[04:21.18] The very next day, "Hey Fab, I''ma kill you!"
[04:23.15] Lyrics comin'' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
[04:25.53] Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin'' I''m a human

[04:28.98] Innovative and I''m made of rubber so that anything
[04:30.56] You say is ricochetin'' off of me, and it''ll glue to you and
[04:32.16] I''m devastating, more than ever demonstrating
[04:33.36] How to give a motherfuckin'' audience a feeling like it''s levitating
[04:35.45] Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
[04:37.06] For the day that they can say I fell off, they''ll be celebrating

[04:48.38] With rock, shock rap with Doc

[04:51.92] I don''t know how to make songs like that

[04:55.98] While I''m rippin'' any one of these verses that versus you
[04:57.57] It''s curtains, I''m inadvertently hurtin'' you
[04:59.32] How many verses I gotta murder to
[05:00.93] Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
[05:04.02] Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
[05:06.92] But look at the accolades these skills brung me
[05:09.19] Full of myself, but still hungry
[05:11.01] I bully myself ''cause I make me do what I put my mind to
[05:14.23] And I''m a million leagues above you
[05:16.37] Ill when I speak in tongues, but it''s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you

[05:25.78] But in my head, there''s something I can feel tugging and struggling
[05:29.19] Angels fight with devils and here''s what they want from me
[05:32.80] They''re askin'' me to eliminate some of the women hate
[05:34.83] But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
[05:36.56] I have, then you may be a little patient
[05:37.26] And more sympathetic to the situation
[05:39.79] And understand the discrimination
[05:41.42] But fuck it, life''s handin'' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
[05:44.78] But if I can''t batter the women
[05:46.28] How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
[05:48.06] Don''t mistake him for Satan; it''s a fatal mistake

[05:52.23] To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and

[01:25.78] Well, that''s alright because I love the way you lie
[01:30.91] I love the way you lie
[01:36.57] I love the way you lie
[01:39.65] 
[01:42.40] You ever loved somebody so much
[01:44.35] You can barely breathe when you''re with ''em?
[01:45.74] You meet and neither one of you even know what hit ''em
[01:48.55] Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get ''em
[01:51.57] Now you''re getting fuckin'' sick of looking at ''em
[01:53.77] You swore you''d never hit ''em, never do nothing to hurt ''em
[01:56.14] Now you''re in each other''s face, spewin'' venom in your words when you spit ''em
[01:59.97] You push, pull each other''s hair, scratch, claw, bit ''em
[02:02.27] Throw ''em down, pin ''em
[02:03.38] So lost in the moments when you''re in ''em
[02:05.03] It''s the rage that took over, it controls you both
[02:07.33] So they say, yeah, best to go your separate ways
[02:09.49] Guess that they don''t know you ''cause today, that was yesterday
[02:12.56] Yesterday is over, it''s a different day
[02:14.12] Sound like broken records playin'' over, but you promised her
[02:16.87] Next time, you''ll show restraint
[02:18.23] You don''t get another chance
[02:19.77] Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
[02:22.40] Now you get to watch her leave out the window
[02:24.17] Guess that''s why they call it windowpane
[02:26.53] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
[02:31.56] Well, that''s alright because I like the way it hurts
[02:37.17] Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
[02:42.51] Well, that''s alright because I love the way you lie
[02:48.29] I love the way you lie
[02:53.13] I love the way you lie
[02:56.71] 
[02:59.92] Now I know we said things, did things that we didn''t mean
[03:02.97] And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
[03:06.02] But your temper''s just as bad as mine is
[03:07.93] You''re the same as me, when it comes to love, you''re just as blinded
[03:10.94] Baby, please come back, it wasn''t you, baby, it was me
[03:14.23] Maybe our relationship isn''t as crazy as it seems
[03:16.99] Maybe that''s what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
[03:20.09] All I know is I love you too much to walk away, though
[03:22.79] Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
[03:25.46] Don''t you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
[03:28.26] Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
[03:31.03] Next time I''m pissed, I''ll aim my fist at the drywall
[03:34.04] "Next time? There will be no next time"
[03:35.84] I apologize, even though I know it''s lies
[03:38.62] I''m tired of the games, I just want her back
[03:40.67] I know I''m a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again
[03:43.58] I''ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
[03:46.20] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
[03:51.34] Well, that''s alright because I like the way it hurts
[03:57.60] Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
[04:02.57] Well, that''s alright, because I love the way you lie
[04:08.26] I love the way you lie
[04:13.67] I love the way you lie
